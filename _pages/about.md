I am a Ph.D. Candidate in [ECE@Purdue University](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) under the supervision of Prof. [Jing Gao](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~jinggao/). Before coming to Purdue, I spent two wonderful years at [University of Michigan](https://nextprof.engin.umich.edu/nextprof-nexus/) to acquire my MS degree in Statistics. Prior to that, I got my BS degree from [Xiamen University](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/main.htm).

<!-- I am interested in building helpful and reliable AI/ML. My current research mainly focuses on building knowledgeable LLMs in efficiency. To this end, I have developed tools to conduct precise and generalizable knowledge update for LLMs. I am also interested in algorithmic fairness and AI safety.  -->

My research goal is to build knowledgeable, trustworthy, and efficient large-scale AI systems. My work is primarily focused on the following pillars:

- **Knowledgeable \& Efficient LLMs**: I develop principled and scalable methods for knowledge editing, 
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and efficient fine-tuning.

- **Trustworthy AI (Fairness, Integrity & Safety)**: A cross-cutting theme of my work is ensuring AI systems are trustworthy. I tackle this from multiple angles: designing algorithms for debiasing models, auditing the vulnerabilities of fairness techniques, and protecting copyright and integrity through robust watermarking.

- **AI-Empowered Systems**: I am passionate about applying AI techniques to solve real-world problems, demonstrated by my work on AI-driven wireless sensing systems.
