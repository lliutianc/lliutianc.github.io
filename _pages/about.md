I am a Ph.D. Candidate in [ECE@Purdue University](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) under the supervision of Prof. [Jing Gao](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~jinggao/). Before coming to Purdue, I spent two wonderful years at [University of Michigan](https://nextprof.engin.umich.edu/nextprof-nexus/) to acquire my MS degree in Statistics. Prior to that, I got my BS degree from [Xiamen University](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/main.htm).

<!-- I am interested in building helpful and reliable AI/ML. My current research mainly focuses on building knowledgeable LLMs in efficiency. To this end, I have developed tools to conduct precise and generalizable knowledge update for LLMs. I am also interested in algorithmic fairness and AI safety.  -->

My research goal is to develop principled methods for building knowledgeable and efficient machine learning models. My work is primarily focused on the following pillars:

- **Knowledgeable & Efficient LLMs**: I design scalable methods for knowledge editing, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and efficient fine-tuning to build precise, adaptable, and resource-efficient (M)LLMs, enabling seamless integration of diverse knowledge sources in real-world deployments.

- **Trustworthy AI/ML**: I create principled methods to understand and improve fairness and integrity in AI systems with minimal data, mitigating risks and delivering reliable outcomes with minimal data requirement.



**I am on the job market and am open to academic positions and industrial research roles. If you believe I might be a good fit for your institution or organization, I'd love to chat! Please feel free to reach out to me liu3351[AT]purdue.edu**
