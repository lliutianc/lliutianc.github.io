I am a Ph.D. Candidate in [ECE@Purdue University](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) under the supervision of Prof. [Jing Gao](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~jinggao/). Before coming to Purdue, I spent two wonderful years at [University of Michigan](https://nextprof.engin.umich.edu/nextprof-nexus/) to acquire my MS degree in Statistics. Prior to that, I got my BS degree from [Xiamen University](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/main.htm).

I am broadly interested in building helpful and reliable AI/ML. My current research focuses on building knowledgeable LLMs in efficiency. To this end, I develop tools to conduct precise and generalizable knowledge update for LLMs. 
I also work on algorithmic fairness and its safety, inverse problems and its applications, and AI-empowered wireless sensing systems.
